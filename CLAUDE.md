- In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- When creating a commit message, do not say "co-authored by Claude". Leave that out.
- When updating the datamodel make sure to generate the types first
- use pnpm for different targets laid out in the package json
